# DSH compatibility policy

MOVO consumes agent runtimes through the versioned `AgentKernelContract`. DSH is
one runtime provider behind that contract; product services and the frontend do
not consume DSH APIs directly. DSH-specific compatibility code belongs in
`dsh/runtime-host/`, in small adapters grouped by upstream subsystem.

| Item | Active baseline | Status | Upgrade rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reviewed upstream source | `5badb15009ae1756c3afe0ae0cef1faafc290ccc` (`dsh-v0.2.1-alpha.1`) | reviewed | review the upstream diff again |
| Deployable npm train | `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.1-alpha.1` | local contract admitted, integrity pinned | pin every DSH package to one exact train |
| Source/package mapping | unavailable upstream | unverified | do not claim cryptographic correspondence |
| Node platform | `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0` | required | test every supported deployment image |
| Host protocol | `askai.dsh-host.v1` | frozen | adapt DSH changes inside Runtime Host |
| Execution projection | `askai.execution-v3` | frozen | version the MOVO contract before changing it |
| Session persistence | upstream JSONL, opaque | V2-to-V3 migration verified | test both readability and semantic continuity |
| DSH Core fork | none | prohibited | never patch vendored or installed DSH source |

## Admitted compatibility behavior

DSH `0.1.6-alpha.1` replaced older Code runtime composition with its PTC
runtime and migrates persisted Code sessions to the native `ptc` preset. The
bridge keeps MOVO's public preset id as `code`; this preserves the existing
product contract and remounts the expected file, shell, Skill and subagent tool
surface after resume. MOVO does not expose the native preset rename.

DSH `0.2.1-alpha.1` replaces directory-loaded presets with declarative preset
rows and a registry. The embedded MOVO Host reuses the official Web patch
declarations, maps their child-plugin module names to the installed DSH
release, and keeps the public `code` preset identity. This second Loader tree
does not inherit the Host's bare-module anchor; without the bridge mapping,
sessions can be created but their tools never start. MOVO also drops the
shipped subagent filter's schedule-tool names because its Host does not mount
those tools; DSH now rejects unknown filter names. Background-job ownership
changed to SessionId, which the cancellation bridge passes to list/kill/wait.

The Session bridge also owns the upstream V3 API differences: persisted reads,
in-memory event snapshots and seeded-session lineage. Cancellation waits for the
official DSH turn and all owned background jobs to settle before it reports a
successful stop. An immediate next turn is therefore part of the admission
contract, not a UI-only check.

V3 also compacts streamed model chunks into the final assistant event and may
carry the effective system prompt as an in-history system message. Dedicated
event and model-request adapters expand those forms back into MOVO's stable
delta/error events and Model Gateway envelope. These translations stay out of
the product service and can be replaced with the DSH provider itself.

## Required automated admission

Every runtime upgrade must prove all of the following against real Host
composition, not mocks alone:

- create, execute, cancel, immediately execute again, dispose, resume and
  execute again;
- resume a session written by the previous release while preserving public
  preset, permission preset and required Code tools;
- fork a completed conversation using the stable MOVO lineage contract;
- expose every governed MOVO tool to both the model and capability inventory;
- discover and load an installed Skill package;
- delegate to a foreground subagent and return its result to the parent;
- pass Host contract, supply-chain, exact-release-train, SBOM and packaged
  smoke gates.

The isolated evaluator in `scripts/evaluate_dsh_candidate.py` installs a
candidate into a temporary workspace. It must never mutate the active runtime
in place. A candidate report can establish contract compatibility; application
regression, packaged smoke and release rollback checks remain release gates.

`0.1.6-alpha.1` is the immediate rollback train. Roll back the complete
versioned release rather than mixing DSH package versions inside one dependency
graph. Because upstream Session migration can be one-way, preserve runtime data
and rehearse rollback against a copy before production release.
